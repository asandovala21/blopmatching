blopmatching - BLOP matching for Stata
==========================================

blopmatching estimates treatment effects from observational data by BLOP matching.
BLOP matching imputes the missing potential outcome for each subject by using an weighted average
of the outcomes of all the subjects that receive the other treatment level.
The vector of weights for each subject is determined by solving a Bi-Level Optimization Problem (BLOP),              
see DÃ­az, Rau and Rivera (2015) for details.


Installation
############

  net from "https://rawgit.com/igutierrezm/blopmatching/master"


Syntax
############

:: 

   blopmatching [if] [in] , outcome(varname) treatment(varname) controls(varlist) [options]

where the first varname is the outcome variable, the second varname is the treatment variable, and varlist contains the covariates, type::

  help blopmatching

for aditional details.
